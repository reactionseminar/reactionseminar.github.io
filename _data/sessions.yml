  title: "Analysis of 10Li and 11Li through intermediate-energy (p,pn) and low-energy transfer reactions"
  description: "11Li has amassed a large interest among nuclear physicists since the seminal works by
Tanihata and collaborators [1], which established it as a halo nuclei through its large reaction
cross section. Since then, it has become the archetypical halo and Borromean nucleus, and its
structure and that of its associated unbound subsystem, 10Li, have been the subject of extensive
study. It is a testament to the challenges involving this nucleus that the structure of 10Li is
under discussion up to this day [2].

In this talk, I will present the analysis of four experiments involving 10Li, including transfer 
at low energies and neutron removal (p, pn) at intermediate ones, through the DWBA and
Transfer to the Continuum formalisms. We use a consistent n-9Li interaction in all of them,
finding a good description of the studied observables in all cases, thus reaching a firm descrip-
tion of the spectrum of 10Li, even in cases were previous analyses seemed contradictory. The
resulst of this analysis can be found in [3-5].

  title: "Unravelling the mechanisms for suppression of complete fusion in reactions of weakly bound nuclei"
  description: "Advanced radioactive beam facilities are opening a new era in nuclear physics, expanding our field into the region close to and beyond the drip lines in the nuclear chart. A very common feature of these nuclides is that they are weakly bound, with low thresholds for removal of one or more nucleons. Studying the reaction dynamics of light weakly-bound nuclei at and near stability with relatively intense beams allows us to perform detailed measurements of the role of weak binding in reaction outcomes.
