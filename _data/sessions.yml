  title: "Analysis of 10Li and 11Li through intermediate-energy (p,pn) and low-energy transfer reactions"
  description: "11Li has amassed a large interest among nuclear physicists since the seminal works by
Tanihata and collaborators [1], which established it as a halo nuclei through its large reaction
cross section. Since then, it has become the archetypical halo and Borromean nucleus, and its
structure and that of its associated unbound subsystem, 10Li, have been the subject of extensive
study. It is a testament to the challenges involving this nucleus that the structure of 10Li is
under discussion up to this day [2].

<br>In this talk, I will present the analysis of four experiments involving 10Li, including transfer 
at low energies and neutron removal (p, pn) at intermediate ones, through the DWBA and
Transfer to the Continuum formalisms. We use a consistent n-9Li interaction in all of them,
finding a good description of the studied observables in all cases, thus reaching a firm description of the spectrum of 10Li, even in cases were previous analyses seemed contradictory. The
results of this analysis can be found in [3-5].

  title: "Systematic nuclear potential for stable, weakly bound and exotic nuclei reactions"
  description: "Nuclei present cluster structures. Light, strongly or weakly bound, stable or exotic, nuclei such
as 6He; 6,7Li; 7,8,9Be; 12,13,14C; 16,18O; among others (isotopes and nuclei), can be considered as results of n;
1,2,3H and 3,4He combinations. It has been evidenced by experimental observations on break-up or transfer reactions.
Thus, to describe stable, weakly bound and exotic nuclei reactions, with the same theoretical approach, is extremely
challenging in nuclear physics. Studying reactions involving weakly bound stable nuclei is a crucial step in between
studying reactions with stable and exotic nuclei and towards a better understanding of the latter.

<br>We present a systematic study of the nuclear potential in a wide systematic involving the elastic scattering of 4,6He,
7,6Li, 9Be,10B and 16,18O projectiles on the same target at energies around the respective Coulomb barriers. 
We will describe the different laboratories and experimental setups used to obtain these data.
We report on optical model analyses based on the double-folding São Paulo potential. 
In addition, we study the effect of Coulomb dipole polarization (CDP) potential, derived from the semi-classical theory 
of Coulomb excitation. Within this approach, we study OP (real and imaginary) strengths as a function of the systems 
4,6He; 6,7,9,11Li; 9,11Be; 12C; 16,18O.
Our OP approach establishes a common basis for stable, weakly bound and exotic nuclei reactions, accounting
for important differences in their reaction mechanisms, which shows to be directly related to their structural properties.

  title: "Unravelling the mechanisms for suppression of complete fusion in reactions of weakly bound nuclei"
  description: "Advanced radioactive beam facilities are opening a new era in nuclear physics, expanding our field into the region close to and beyond the drip lines in the nuclear chart. A very common feature of these nuclides is that they are weakly bound, with low thresholds for removal of one or more nucleons. Studying the reaction dynamics of light weakly-bound nuclei at and near stability with relatively intense beams allows us to perform detailed measurements of the role of weak binding in reaction outcomes.
 
 <br>An important consequence of weak-binding in reactions of the light weakly-bound nuclei, 6,7,8Li and 9Be, is the suppression of complete fusion cross-sections by ~30 % at above-barrier energies compared to barrier penetration models, together with an associated large yield of incomplete fusion. The mechanism for the suppression of complete fusion has long been thought to be due to projectile breakup prior to reaching the fusion barrier. However, recent work has shown that the yields and characteristic timescales of breakup cannot explain the degree of fusion suppression.
 
<br>I will discuss recent measurements of the energy and angles of singles and coincidence Z=1,2 particles produced in above-barrier reactions of 7Li + 209Bi designed to reveal the mechanism behind incomplete fusion.  By subtracting the alpha-particles produced in no-capture breakup from those of the inclusive prompt alpha-particles, we extract cross-sections for alpha-particles unaccompanied by any other charged fragment. These are necessarily associated with incomplete fusion processes forming polonium isotopes.
 
<br>The characteristics of the unaccompanied alpha-particles are inconsistent with the conventional picture of breakup of 7Li followed by capture of a Z=1 fragment. The energy and angular distributions of the unaccompanied alpha particles suggest a direct, single step mechanism for incomplete fusion, where a triton is captured by the 209Bi target to produce 212Po, which subsequently evaporates neutrons consistent with statistical decay models.  These results are consistent with recent calculations using inclusive breakup models that suggest incomplete fusion is largely dominated by direct capture from the projectile ground state.

  title: "Dissecting calculations of breakup and transfer reactions with halo nuclei using halo effective field theory"
  description: "Halo nuclei exhibit a very exotic structure compared to stable nuclei [1]. Their major characteristic is a very large matter radius. This unusual size is now qualitatively understood as being due to their low separation energy for one or two neutrons. Thanks to this loose binding, these valence neutrons can wander far away from the other nucleons, forming like a diffuse halo around a compact core. Archetypical examples of such exotic structures are the one-neutron halo nuclei 11Be and 15C, and 6He and 11Li, with two neutrons in their halo. Being mostly found close to the neutron dripline, halo nuclei exhibit short lifetimes. Information about their structure has thus to be gathered from indirect techniques. Reactions performed at RIB facilities, like elastic scattering, transfer or breakup, are often used to study the structure of these exotic nuclei [1]. In order to infer reliable information from such measurements, the reaction mechanism must be well understood. An accurate model of the reaction coupled to a realistic description of the projectile is thus needed [2].
<br>Since the early days of RIBs, various models of reactions have been developed, which have helped us better grasp the dynamics of these reactions [2]. It is also very important to understand what structure information can be obtained from the actual reaction measurements. Recently, we have suggested to couple accurate models of reactions to a description of halo nuclei within an effective field theory (Halo-EFT) [3]. Halo EFT [4] is built on the clear separation of scales that appear in halo nuclei: the loose of the halo opposed to the tight binding of the core. It enables us to expand the core-halo Hamiltonian in a power series of the small parameter obtained as the ratio of the small scale divided by the large scale. Each coefficient of this expansion can be related to nuclear-structure observables of the nucleus: its binding energy, the scattering length in the core-halo continuum etc. This very systematic expansion enables us to clearly estimate the structure observables, which affect the reaction process, and hence which can be inferred from actual measurements.
<br>Initiated on breakup [3,5], this idea has been successfully extended to transfer [6,7] and knockout [8]. In addition to provide valuable information about the nuclear-structure observables that are probed by the reactions, this new method enables also to reliable constrain the description of halo nuclei used within reaction codes on ab-initio calculations of halo nuclei, which have now become possible, see, e.g., Ref.[9].
<br>In this online seminar, I will present this new idea and illustrate it on the particular case of 11Be [3,5,7,9] and 15C [7,8] for breakup, transfer and knockout reactions.

  title: "Surrogates for Neutron-Induced Reactions in the FRIB era"
  description: "<br>Neutron-induced reactions play a critical role in stellar nucleosynthesis. However, due to the short half-lives of the nuclei that participate in these processes, direct measurements of the reaction cross sections are very challenging or impossible. The difficulty in directly determining these important cross sections has motivated the development of several indirect techniques for constraining them, one of which is the Surrogate Reactions Method. This method experimentally constrains the desired cross section by measuring the decay of the “same” compound nucleus (CN) formed in a reaction that is easier to measure. The decay of the CN is measured, and observables from its decay are used to constrain parameters in Hauser-Feshbach calculations of the cross section for the desired reaction. 
  <br>However, the entry spin distribution with which the CN is formed strongly influences its decay, so understanding the entry spin distribution for the CN made in the surrogate reaction is critical to the success of the Surrogate Reactions Method. I will discuss our efforts to understand the entry spin distribution induced by different reactions and the theoretical and experimental information required to do so. I also will share results from our applications of this technique to several neutron-capture reactions, thus far for measurements in normal kinematics. I will give prospects for the extension of this technique to inverse kinematics and for future measurements, for neutron capture as well as for other neutron-induced reactions.

  title: "Extracting B(E1) distributions from Coulomb-dominated break-up cross sections"
  description: '<br>Experimental measurements of the B(E1) distributions of weakly bound nuclei are carried out by means of 
Break-up experiments, on heavy targets. The measured break-up cross sections are interpreted using a simple
reaction model, called the Equivalent Photon Method (EPM), which allows to extract "experimental" B(E1) distributions,
which are, essentially, proportional to the break-up cross sections.
This procedure can lead to cases, such as 11Be, for which incompatible experimental B(E1) distributions arise from
break-up cross sections measured at different energies. 

<br>Here we indicate how can one use state of the art reaction calculations, beyond EPM, to extract B(E1) distributions from the
break-up cross sections, despite the uncertainties in the nuclear interactions and reaction dynamics. This proper
reaction treatment produces B(E1) distributions for 11Be from break-up cross sections at different energies which are fully compatible.'

  title: "Investigation of nuclear reactions for the applications in Advance reactor, ADSS facility and nuclear data management"
  description: "Enormous amount of experimental work has been carried out in low energy neutron induced reactions of actinides and nuclear structural materials [1-4]. However, experimental nuclear data in medium to high-energy neutron induced reactions are rare and very much limited. There is strong need to measure reaction cross sections of reactor fuel, cladding and shielding materials to the medium energy region with mono-energetic neutrons and also with protons and photons. Measurements of the different types of reaction cross sections in the above-mentioned energy region will help us to understand the energy dependence of the activation cross-sections in detail. This could lead us to develop Accelerator Driven Subcritical Systems (ADSs); which would be the future of reactor technology from the India’s perspective [5]. Along with ADSs, International Thermonuclear Experimental reactor (ITER) can also be a sustainable energy source in future. Therefore, it is necessary to study the neutron capture cross-sections for its magnetic materials, since the magnets used for holding the plasma get irradiated with secondary neutrons which are produced in the operation. There is strong need to measure reaction cross sections of fuel materials and reactor cladding and shielding materials to the medium energy region with mono-energetic neutrons.

  title: "Uncertainty Quantification for Reaction Theory"
  description: "The rigorous quantification of uncertainties in nuclear theory has gained a more prominent role over the last several years.  In few-body reaction theory, there are four main sources of uncertainties, coming from the effective interactions, approximations made in solving the few-body problem, the structure function, and degrees of freedom left out of the model space.  In this talk, I will detail the evolution of our techniques to quantify theoretical uncertainties, from standard chi-square minimization and covariance propagation to Bayesian methods, concentrating on the uncertainties that come from fitting the optical model to elastic scattering data.  I will discuss how these uncertainties propagate to single-nucleon transfer cross sections, and show comparisons between two different reaction theory formalisms.  Finally, I will make connections to my current work at Los Alamos."

  title: "Constraining the momentum dependence of the Nuclear Equation of State"
  description: "<br>Nucleons in dense nuclear matter appear to have reduced inertial masses due to momentum-dependent interactions they experience with other nucleons. This reduction of their masses is often referred to as their effective mass, and at saturation density the effective masses are about 70% of their vacuum mass. In asymmetric matter the effective masses of neutrons and protons can be different, leading to an effective-mass splitting. The sign and magnitude of this splitting is poorly constrained at densities away from saturation density. 
<br>Recent experiments at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory were performed to help constrain these momentum-dependent interactions. By measuring the kinetic energy spectra of neutrons and protons, or analogously using “pseudo neutrons” from measured tritons and helium-3, the sign and magnitude of this effective-mass splitting can be extracted, with the help of transport models. Collisions of beams of 40,48Ca at 50 and 140 MeV/A impinged on targets of 58,64Ni and 112,124Sn, and the light, charged particles and neutrons emitted in these collisions were detected. Charged particles up to boron were detected, with isotopic resolution, in the upgraded High-Resolution Array and neutrons were detected in the Large-Area Neuron Array. I will discuss some of the important physics motivations for studying the nuclear Equation of State, present details about the experiment setup, and then discuss some first results on the spectral ratios with comparisons to transport model calculations. At the end I will discuss the future directions that can be looked forward to at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams.
