  title: "Analysis of 10Li and 11Li through intermediate-energy (p,pn) and low-energy transfer reactions"
  description: "11Li has amassed a large interest among nuclear physicists since the seminal works by
Tanihata and collaborators [1], which established it as a halo nuclei through its large reaction
cross section. Since then, it has become the archetypical halo and Borromean nucleus, and its
structure and that of its associated unbound subsystem, 10Li, have been the subject of extensive
study. It is a testament to the challenges involving this nucleus that the structure of 10Li is
under discussion up to this day [2].

<br>In this talk, I will present the analysis of four experiments involving 10Li, including transfer 
at low energies and neutron removal (p, pn) at intermediate ones, through the DWBA and
Transfer to the Continuum formalisms. We use a consistent n-9Li interaction in all of them,
finding a good description of the studied observables in all cases, thus reaching a firm description of the spectrum of 10Li, even in cases were previous analyses seemed contradictory. The
results of this analysis can be found in [3-5].

  title: "Unravelling the mechanisms for suppression of complete fusion in reactions of weakly bound nuclei"
  description: "Advanced radioactive beam facilities are opening a new era in nuclear physics, expanding our field into the region close to and beyond the drip lines in the nuclear chart. A very common feature of these nuclides is that they are weakly bound, with low thresholds for removal of one or more nucleons. Studying the reaction dynamics of light weakly-bound nuclei at and near stability with relatively intense beams allows us to perform detailed measurements of the role of weak binding in reaction outcomes.
 
 <br>An important consequence of weak-binding in reactions of the light weakly-bound nuclei, 6,7,8Li and 9Be, is the suppression of complete fusion cross-sections by ~30 % at above-barrier energies compared to barrier penetration models, together with an associated large yield of incomplete fusion. The mechanism for the suppression of complete fusion has long been thought to be due to projectile breakup prior to reaching the fusion barrier. However, recent work has shown that the yields and characteristic timescales of breakup cannot explain the degree of fusion suppression.
 
<br>I will discuss recent measurements of the energy and angles of singles and coincidence Z=1,2 particles produced in above-barrier reactions of 7Li + 209Bi designed to reveal the mechanism behind incomplete fusion.  By subtracting the alpha-particles produced in no-capture breakup from those of the inclusive prompt alpha-particles, we extract cross-sections for alpha-particles unaccompanied by any other charged fragment. These are necessarily associated with incomplete fusion processes forming polonium isotopes.
 
<br>The characteristics of the unaccompanied alpha-particles are inconsistent with the conventional picture of breakup of 7Li followed by capture of a Z=1 fragment. The energy and angular distributions of the unaccompanied alpha particles suggest a direct, single step mechanism for incomplete fusion, where a triton is captured by the 209Bi target to produce 212Po, which subsequently evaporates neutrons consistent with statistical decay models.  These results are consistent with recent calculations using inclusive breakup models that suggest incomplete fusion is largely dominated by direct capture from the projectile ground state.

  title: "Dissecting calculations of breakup and transfer reactions with halo nuclei using halo effective field theory"
  description: "Halo nuclei exhibit a very exotic structure compared to stable nuclei [1]. Their major characteristic is a very large matter radius. This unusual size is now qualitatively understood as being due to their low separation energy for one or two neutrons. Thanks to this loose binding, these valence neutrons can wander far away from the other nucleons, forming like a diffuse halo around a compact core. Archetypical examples of such exotic structures are the one-neutron halo nuclei 11Be and 15C, and 6He and 11Li, with two neutrons in their halo. Being mostly found close to the neutron dripline, halo nuclei exhibit short lifetimes. Information about their structure has thus to be gathered from indirect techniques. Reactions performed at RIB facilities, like elastic scattering, transfer or breakup, are often used to study the structure of these exotic nuclei [1]. In order to infer reliable information from such measurements, the reaction mechanism must be well understood. An accurate model of the reaction coupled to a realistic description of the projectile is thus needed [2].
<br>Since the early days of RIBs, various models of reactions have been developed, which have helped us better grasp the dynamics of these reactions [2]. It is also very important to understand what structure information can be obtained from the actual reaction measurements. Recently, we have suggested to couple accurate models of reactions to a description of halo nuclei within an effective field theory (Halo-EFT) [3]. Halo EFT [4] is built on the clear separation of scales that appear in halo nuclei: the loose of the halo opposed to the tight binding of the core. It enables us to expand the core-halo Hamiltonian in a power series of the small parameter obtained as the ratio of the small scale divided by the large scale. Each coefficient of this expansion can be related to nuclear-structure observables of the nucleus: its binding energy, the scattering length in the core-halo continuum etc. This very systematic expansion enables us to clearly estimate the structure observables, which affect the reaction process, and hence which can be inferred from actual measurements.
<br>Initiated on breakup [3,5], this idea has been successfully extended to transfer [6,7] and knockout [8]. In addition to provide valuable information about the nuclear-structure observables that are probed by the reactions, this new method enables also to reliable constrain the description of halo nuclei used within reaction codes on ab-initio calculations of halo nuclei, which have now become possible, see, e.g., Ref.[9].
<br>In this online seminar, I will present this new idea and illustrate it on the particular case of 11Be [3,5,7,9] and 15C [7,8] for breakup, transfer and knockout reactions.

  title: "Surrogates for Neutron-Induced Reactions in the FRIB era"
  description: "<br>Neutron-induced reactions play a critical role in stellar nucleosynthesis. However, due to the short half-lives of the nuclei that participate in these processes, direct measurements of the reaction cross sections are very challenging or impossible. The difficulty in directly determining these important cross sections has motivated the development of several indirect techniques for constraining them, one of which is the Surrogate Reactions Method. This method experimentally constrains the desired cross section by measuring the decay of the “same” compound nucleus (CN) formed in a reaction that is easier to measure. The decay of the CN is measured, and observables from its decay are used to constrain parameters in Hauser-Feshbach calculations of the cross section for the desired reaction. 
  <br>However, the entry spin distribution with which the CN is formed strongly influences its decay, so understanding the entry spin distribution for the CN made in the surrogate reaction is critical to the success of the Surrogate Reactions Method. I will discuss our efforts to understand the entry spin distribution induced by different reactions and the theoretical and experimental information required to do so. I also will share results from our applications of this technique to several neutron-capture reactions, thus far for measurements in normal kinematics. I will give prospects for the extension of this technique to inverse kinematics and for future measurements, for neutron capture as well as for other neutron-induced reactions.
