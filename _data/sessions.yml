  title: "Analysis of 10Li and 11Li through intermediate-energy (p,pn) and low-energy transfer reactions"
  description: "11Li has amassed a large interest among nuclear physicists since the seminal works by
Tanihata and collaborators [1], which established it as a halo nuclei through its large reaction
cross section. Since then, it has become the archetypical halo and Borromean nucleus, and its
structure and that of its associated unbound subsystem, 10Li, have been the subject of extensive
study. It is a testament to the challenges involving this nucleus that the structure of 10Li is
under discussion up to this day [2]."
