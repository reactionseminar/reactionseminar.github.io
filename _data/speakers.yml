  title: "Professor"
  bio: "I am currently working in the theory group of the Institute for Nuclear Physics of the Johannes-Gutenberg University Mainz (Germany). I work in nuclear-reaction theory on the development of models of reactions involving halo nuclei and the analysis of measurements with the goal of improving our understanding of the structure of these exotic systems.
<br>  After engineering studies in Brussels and Paris, I have obtained my PhD from the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in 2004. I have held a few post-doctoral positions in Canada (TRIUMF theory group) and in the US (NSCL theory group at MSU) before obtaining a permanent position in Brussels. I have moved to Germany in 2018."

  name: "Andrew"
  surname: "Ratkiewicz"
  company: "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"
  title: "Staff Scientist"
  bio: "I did my PhD work at the NSCL studying nuclear structure. Subsequently I worked as a postdoc at ORNL, supported by Rutgers University. While there I designed and led the fabrication and commissioning of the GODDESS particle-gamma spectrometer, which (I humbly believe, but mean no offense in saying) is the world's most powerful such detector. I also worked on the development of the Surrogate Reactions Method, leading an experiment that demonstrated the utility of the (d,p) reaction as an (n,gamma) surrogate. Then I went to LLNL, where I am now a member of staff. At LLNL I work on Surrogates, neutron-induced reaction measurements, and probing the strength of the interaction between nuclei and plasmas."
